# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created an unique study guide that visually pops out at the reader due to its calming beautiful colors and easy to read format. My motivation was to have a website that I can refer back to, as well as, add to in the future during my time in the coding bootcamp. It will help me study and keep track of notes in a fun way. I learned an abudent amount of foundational skills relating to HTML, CSS, JS, and GIT that I will use as I grow and become more fluent as a computer programmer.

## Installation
N/A for this project.

## Usage
